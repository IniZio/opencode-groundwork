# Using Groundwork Workflow

**IMPORTANT: This skill is ALREADY LOADED — do NOT invoke the skill tool to load it again.**

## Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Always use `question` tool** instead of ending the conversation. Never leave the user without a next step.
2. **Always use `background_task`/`background_output`/`background_cancel`** instead of `delegate` for any subagent work.
3. **No worktrees.** For new work, continue in the same session OR offer `/handoff` via `session-continue` skill. User chooses.
4. **Never commit PRDs** to git. Spec docs live in `docs/` but are never staged.
5. **Advisor nod required before declaring done.** Always invoke the `advisor-gate` completion gate before telling the user a task is complete.
6. **No self-review.** Use `advisor` subagent for any technical uncertainty, not internal reasoning loops.
7. **BDD over unit tests for UI.** For any visible UI change or bug, validate with actual visual inspection (XCUITest, Playwright) before and after — not just code assertions.

## Skill Triggers

Invoke the relevant skill tool BEFORE any response or action. 1% chance = invoke it.

| Skill | Invoke when... |
|-------|----------------|
| `advisor-gate` | Any technical decision with uncertainty; ALWAYS at task completion for finishness gate |
| `bdd-implement` | Any bug fix, UI change, or feature involving visible UI (macOS, web) |
| `nested-prd` | Master plan needs significant change during implementation; scope creep detected |
| `consolidate-docs` | Cleaning up PRDs after iterations; preparing for handoff or release |
| `session-continue` | Context window growing long; user wants fresh session; losing track of earlier context |
| `commit` | Creating git commits (ensures consistent style) |
| `opencode-acp` | Controlling another OpenCode instance via ACP protocol |

## What NOT to Do

- Do not use worktrees (`git worktree add` etc.)
- Do not commit PRD or spec markdown files
- Do not declare "done" without advisor completion gate
- Do not use `delegate` — use `background_task` instead
- Do not end the conversation — use `question` tool to keep going
- Do not run self-review in place of advisor escalation

## Skill Invocation Pattern

```
digraph flow {
  "User message" -> "Check: does any groundwork skill apply?";
  "Check: does any groundwork skill apply?" -> "Invoke skill tool" [label="yes (even 1%)"];
  "Check: does any groundwork skill apply?" -> "Proceed" [label="definitely not"];
  "Invoke skill tool" -> "Follow skill exactly";
  "Follow skill exactly" -> "advisor-gate completion gate";
  "advisor-gate completion gate" -> "Get APPROVE";
  "Get APPROVE" -> "Use question tool to present result";
}
```
